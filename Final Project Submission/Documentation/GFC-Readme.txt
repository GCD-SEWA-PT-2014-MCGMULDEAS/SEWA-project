Read-Me:
For the benefit of prospective users, a ReadMe.txt file for more detailed granular information and process steps is available as part of our documentations. This will provided some guidance and directions for users new to the Site design on how to use / access the different pages, functionality and interfaces of the Website design.

Home Page
Linking on this page displays a number of images rotating in the centre of the screen with a live twitter feed on the column on the right and a number of links to points on the home page in the column to the left.
Across the top of the page is a navigation bar with a 5 options to link with the key pages. On hovering over these menu headings a submenu will appear offering links to a number of points on the various pages.
Scrolling down the page will allow the reader access to content according to the headings on the panel on the left hand side.
On the footer there are a number of ‘Sample links’ which are not connected for the purposes of this project as well as logos for connecting to twitter, facebook etc.

About us Page
This page has details on the project team and gives the user an understanding of how the site is used and how it can benefit them. Towards the end of the page are a few sample resources including pdf downloads, links to websites and a sample video embedded. The idea would be to grow the resource library for users giving them a variety of tools that could improve their performance. 

Contact us Page
This page includes a form which the user can complete to send an enquiry as well as an embedded google map to find our base (GCD).

Registration
This page must be completed before the user can get into the site proper and use the analysis tools.

On the right hand side panel the details previously entered by the user will appear. On the left hand side there are a selection of links that the user can connect to for feedback on the input they have completed on the current visit as well as their historical data that can be retrieved.
In the centre of the page are two forms. These have been kept deliberately short to allow the user complete them quickly and get immediate feedback on their input.
